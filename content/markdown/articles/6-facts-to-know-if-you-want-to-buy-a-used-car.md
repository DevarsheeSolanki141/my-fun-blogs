Buying a used car is becoming more popular as a result of low inventory and high prices for new cars. Before jumping in a pre-owned vehicle and driving away, we’ve broken down some things you should know before signing the dotted line. We know we can get pretty wordy as a result of our passion for the automotive industry, but just like we make car buying quick and convenient, we’re going to attempt the same here. Basically, we’re giving you a broken-down list of things to consider when [buying a used car](https://blog.ffun.com/articles/what-to-know-when-buying-a-used-car-in-canada/) instead of a new vehicle in Canada.

## Know What You’re Buying

Buying used comes with its own guidebook, and one of the steps is to do your research. Start by researching vehicles you are considering so you can see if there are any common issues across the board. Get the [vehicle history report](https://blog.ffuncars.com/articles/what-does-the-carfax-report-provide/)! If a car dealer or private seller refuses to provide you with one, take that as a red flag. If they don’t want to provide one, ask for the VIN (vehicle identification number) and get one done yourself through CARFAX. A history report will provide you with any claims the car has gone through, including its accident history. Naturally, pre-owned cars will have wear and tear so consider that when determining your price range. Did you know that if you buy from FFUN Cars, every vehicle has gone through a meticulous 92-point inspection? Yup, they sure have. Never be afraid to ask for maintenance records. If the vehicle is in good shape, the previous owner will have no issue producing them.

## Look Under the Hood

Yes, get a vehicle history report, but don’t take that as the only gospel, as it only has things that were reported. Do your own independent inspection under the hood, around the body, and the interior, including the upholstery of the vehicle. To give yourself peace of mind before handing money over to a car dealership or private seller, take the vehicle in for a pre-purchase inspection. Sure, we say look under the hood, but also check the tires. The last thing you want is to buy a vehicle and then have to replace the tires right away. If the tires are no good, but you want the vehicle, factor that in when negotiating a price.

## What Are You Getting

Just because a vehicle is used, doesn’t mean it doesn’t have new vehicle extras. If the used vehicle you are looking at is only a few years old, there’s a good chance it still has some of the manufacturer’s warranty left. Make sure you ask about this so you don’t get suckered into buying an extended warranty that you don’t need. If your vehicle has a bunch of extra features such as heated seats and a backup camera, check to make sure they work. This is all part of knowing what you are paying for. There’s probably a good chance that you won’t drive the car forever; people change vehicles all the time. To save yourself some money on your next purchase, find a vehicle that is known to have a great resale value - it’s awesome when you can [use a car as a trade-in](https://ffuncars.com/trade-in).

## The Total Cost of Ownership

When determining what your budget is, consider what the total cost of ownership is. To come up with an estimate, look at the average cost of maintenance and repairs, the cost of car insurance, and the fuel economy. Do the research yourself instead of asking a salesperson; they will tell you anything to get you into a vehicle. It’s called commission sales, something we don’t have at FFUN Cars. We sell the best used cars and are 100% transparent, just like our car buying is 100% all about your convenience. There is no haggling with anyone, there are no hidden fees, and you can ask us whatever questions you want knowing you will get an honest answer.

## Test-drive

Please, please, please, whatever you do, never buy a vehicle (new or used) without test-driving it first. On paper, it could be your dream vehicle, but you may not like the way it handles - something you won’t know until you test drive it. We aren’t talking around the block a few times. Take it for an actual test drive. Or, buy from us and you’ll get to enjoy a 24-hour test drive. Not to mention, we offer a 30-day money-back guarantee.

## Financing

Just like car salespeople can be sneaky, so can lenders. To avoid being raked over the coals, know how you plan to purchase the vehicle before you get to the finance guys. You can start by [getting approved](https://ffuncars.com/approval/information) without impacting your credit score. If you are trying to keep your monthly payments low, here’s a hint; come up with a down payment.

At the end of the day, you need to find a vehicle that works for you and your lifestyle. With countless dealerships surrounding you, it’s hard to know where to shop. Take some pressure off yourself by sitting down on your couch and [browsing our inventory of vehicles](https://ffuncars.com/search-vehicles). From there, you can complete the transaction online or visit us in-store - it’s up to you.
