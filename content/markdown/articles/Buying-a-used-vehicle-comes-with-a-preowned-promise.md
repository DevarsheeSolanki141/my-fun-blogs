Pre-owned vehicles, also known as used cars, are those that have had at least one owner in the past. Their prices can vary depending on the make, model, year, and condition of the car. Certainly, the condition of a pre-owned car ranks high on the list of considerations for any potential buyer. A well-maintained pre-owned vehicle promises not only longevity but also fewer problems and repairs. This makes it a sound investment.

Furthermore, depending on its age, a pre-owned car may still be under warranty.

However, what if we could take this a step further? At FFUN dealerships, we go beyond just selling you a pre-owned car—we provide a Pre-Owned Promise. This is our commitment to you, ensuring value, trust and peace of mind in your pre-owned vehicle decision.

## Benefits of Buying a Pre-Owned Car at a FFUN Dealership

Here are some of the advantages you get when buying a pre-owned car from us:

## Rigorous Inspection and Certification Process:

FFUN understands the significance of reliability when it comes to used vehicles. That’s why every pre-owned vehicle on our lot undergoes a thorough 120-point inspection by Factory Certified Technicians. This comprehensive inspection covers all major components, ensuring that the vehicle meets our stringent standards for quality and performance.

## Transparent History and Ownership:

When you buy a pre-owned vehicle from one of our dealerships, you can trust that its history and ownership have been carefully verified. We provide a free CARFAX report for every vehicle to give you complete peace of mind. No more worrying about hidden accidents or undisclosed issues. We believe in full transparency.

## Comprehensive Warranty Coverage:

We stand behind the quality of our pre-owned vehicles by offering limited extended warranty coverage for three months and 3,000 km. This warranty covers various engine, transmission and drive components, providing you with added protection and peace of mind.

## Market-Based Pricing:

We believe in fair and competitive pricing and that’s why our pre-owned vehicles are priced to market to ensure that you get the best value for your money. Additionally, we have non-commission staff dedicated to finding you the perfect vehicle at a price that fits your budget.

## Flexible Return and Exchange Policy:

We understand that purchasing a vehicle is a significant decision, and sometimes, it may not meet your expectations. That’s why we offer a 3-day/250 KM money-back guarantee on pre-owned vehicles. If, within the specified period, the purchased vehicle doesn’t meet your needs, you can choose to exchange it or get a full refund.

## Manufacturer Warranty Coverage:

Many of our pre-owned vehicles still have coverage under the manufacturer’s warranty. That means you can enjoy the benefits of a reliable vehicle without worrying about unexpected repair costs.

## Bottom Line: Buying a used Vehicle Comes with a Pre-Owned Promise

Buying a used vehicle at a FFUN dealership means that you can trust in both the quality and service behind your purchase.
