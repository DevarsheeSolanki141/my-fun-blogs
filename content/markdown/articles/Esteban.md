Meet Esteban Fuenzalida, Parts Advisor at The Rock Harley-Davidson. Esteban brings over 15 years of experience in the automotive industry, with a specialization in advising customers on parts and customization. Unlike traditional auto companies where the focus is primarily on parts, Esteban emphasizes that at Harley-Davidson, customization takes precedence, making up 60-70% of his role. He understands that it's not just the technical requirements but also the unique tastes and preferences of each customer, whether it's deciphering the desired sound from the exhaust or adjusting handlebars for the perfect ride position. With a background in heavy machinery, particularly trucks, Esteban's transition to Harley-Davidson fulfills a long-standing ambition, driven by his passion for motorcycles. Having joined The Rock Harley-Davidson under the FFUN umbrella almost a year ago, Esteban brings a wealth of expertise as an auto mechanic engineer with a degree to match. Let's get to know Esteban beyond Harley. 

## 1.WHERE ARE YOU ORIGINALLY FROM?

Esteban is originally from Santiago, Chile, and three and a half years ago, he made the move to Canada, specifically to Niagara. He originally came to Canada for training purposes, and he was drawn to Niagara due to visiting before. After a few years in Canada, the opportunity at The Rock Harley-Davidson came up in Sudbury, presenting Esteban with his dream opportunity.

## 3.WHAT ARE YOUR TOP TWO BUCKET LIST ITEMS? 

Esteban's top two bucket list items revolve around travel and connection to his roots. Riding across Canada on a Harley represents the epitome of freedom and adventure, as he imagines the vast landscapes and open roads. Equally significant is his dream to revisit Chile, his homeland, to reconnect with his family.


## 4.DO YOU HAVE A FAVOURITE VACATION SPOT?

## 8.Do you like cities or remote places better?

Esteban admits he is drawn to remote places over cities. Despite the allure of fancy jobs in urban centers, he appreciates the simplicity of rural living. Having experienced both, he values the unique blend of nature and solitude that places like Sudbury offers. Unlike in Chile, where good job opportunities seem confined to city limits, Esteban is happy he can live in a more remote place like Sudbury and still maintain a good job.
