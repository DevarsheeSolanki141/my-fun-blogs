This Easter will definitely be a year we wonâ€™t forget. We traded in family gatherings, and traditional Easter egg hunts, for family zoom calls and inside activities. It hasnâ€™t been the most ideal situation, but even during the toughest times, we see people coming together every day to help each other out, and we believe we will all come out of this stronger than ever! Which is why we wanted to make a difference during this time and bring Easter to 50 lucky kids!

Our marketing staff had a blast putting together each bag and filling them with all kinds of surprises! We added loads of chocolates, crafts and FFUN activities because we know how tough it has been to entertain the kids every single day!

After we picked the 50 lucky kids at random, Kyle, our marketing Vice-President, got his 2 mini bunnies to help him deliver the bags! They had so much fun hopping up to the door steps, ringing the doorbell, running away, and waving to the surprised families from the road!

Some families even shared their Easter surprise moments and it made our day!

Try watching it without smiling, we dare you ðŸ˜‰

We really enjoyed doing this for these families and we are happy to bring some light in these unprecedented times. We know if we keep working together as a Team, we will kick this thing to the curve. We are looking forward to seeing more familiar faces at our dealerships hopefully soon! If you have any questions, or want to check out our deals right now, please donâ€™t hesitant to call us! We can bring the dealership to you!
