With summer coming to a close we can not help but reminisce on the exciting times we were able to experience these past couple of months. A large stand out for us here at FFUN was the FIBA 3×3 tournament. For the second year we were a major sponsor, and to put it simply we loved every second of it. Downtown Saskatoon in the summer months is such an exciting place to begin with, but bring an awesome location, excited fans and extremely talented athletes together and you have an even bigger recipe for success.

July 20th and 21st downtown Saskatoon was transformed into a basketball 3×3 paradise. People flocked to watch a newly recognized Olympic sport come to life. In between games we had mini games and contests set up that allowed patrons to show off their basketball skills or give their best guesses for the scores of the games. We had so much fun interacting with everyone and seeing all of the skills that were shown. Saskatoon is full of awesome events all summer long, but this is definitely a highlight for the people of Saskatoon!

Here at FFUN we are all about coming together and working as a team to produce our best result. Our four core values; driven to grow, team player, ffun attitude and down to earth. We are the reason for our success, we achieve more when working as a team, we have FFUN while striving for excellence, and we are hard-working and humble individuals and these values are something we take pride in. We see these same qualities in the teams & spectators throughout the tournament which made it such a perfect fit for us to be a major sponsor.

We believe having events like this here in our city continually brings us all together and creates camaraderie. The athletes that travel and are representing their city are a great example for the youth coming up at what hard work and determination look like, and that it is okay to fail as long as you get back up and keep pushing forward.

Unfortunately, Team Saskatoon did not have their best showing (9th out of 12) but the Canadian teams were able to step it up and grab all of the awards for the skills competition. The winning team will receive $30,000. Runner-up gets $20,000. Third place includes a $12,000 payout and fourth place means $8,000.

The teams compete for a ticket to the FIBA Masters Tour final and the top 12 teams in the World Tour season standings — including the winners of each Masters event — qualify for the final.

FIBA 3×3 is the quickest format of basketball. The games are 10 minutes, with 12 second shot-clock. Players do not get a break after scoring and there are no halftimes or quarters!! So if you have never been and like high intensity action and a crowd full of energy, then this is an event you will certainly need to look into.

FFUN Facts About FIBA & Basketball:
