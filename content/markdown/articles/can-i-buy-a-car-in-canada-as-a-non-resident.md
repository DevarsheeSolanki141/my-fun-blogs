Buying a car in Canada is effortless once you know the requirements. You only need a valid driving license, identification, and address. Other things to consider include car insurance, license plate registration, and documentation. Buying from a Canadian dealership is popular, but you can find other options. You can purchase a new or used car, depending on your needs. As a non-resident, you can buy a car in Ontario, Toronto, Alberta, Quebec, Vancouver, Montreal, Saskatchewan, British Columbia and all other Canadian provinces and territories. FFUN Financial also offers you low-interest loans you can use to get your first car.

## Consideration for Buying a Car in Canada

Although you don’t have to be a Canadian citizen to buy a new car, you must meet various provincial requirements. The most important requirement is your driver's licence. You can provide an international driving permit if you're new to Canada. Most provinces also allow you to buy a car with a learner’s permit. Proof of address is the other important requirement when buying a car as a non-resident. If you’re in Canada on vacation, you can provide the address of your hotel. Here are other considerations for buying new or used vehicles in Canada:

- **Transfer of Ownership:** Complete your new vehicle registration with the road authority, even if the transfer is between family members.

- **Sales Tax:** You’ll pay a sales tax, which can be a general goods and service tax (GST), provincial sales tax (PST), or a harmonized sales tax (HST).

- **Car Insurance Coverage:** Every new car purchase requires an insurance policy. If you live in British Columbia, you can get basic auto insurance from ICBC.

## How to Buy a Car in Canada as a Non-resident

Buying Canadian cars should be easy enough if you meet the minimum requirements. Simply put up the down payment or the full purchase price. If you're seeking a loan, make sure your credit history is healthy to attract low interest. You can provide your American driving license if you're from America (USA). Canada also accepts licenses from Australia and other regions. If you drive on the right side of the road in your home country, you should have no problem navigating Canadian roads. Below are the steps involved in buying a car in Canada as a non-resident:

- Organize your documentation, including your work permit, ID, international driving permit and credit card details.

- Decide on the type of vehicle you want to buy based on your needs. For instance, a campervan may be the best option for a road trip.

- Check the laws in your province, including requirements and exemptions. This is important for all buyers, including if you’re a permanent resident.

- Visit a car dealership or private seller. You can also contact the dealership online to compare existing cars.

- Get the car inspected. If you’re using a private seller, check the driving record, warranty and emissions.

- Go for a road test to assess your driving experience. If you love the vehicle, complete the transfer of ownership.

- Contact an insurance company or a local insurance provider like ICBC. Note that motor vehicle insurance rates and policies vary from provider to provider.
