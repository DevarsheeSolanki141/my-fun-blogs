Being a car owner offers freedom that is unavailable in public transport. However, that freedom comes with much responsibility. Most vehicle owners get intimidated by car maintenance durations and costs. If you are a [first-time driver](https://ffun.com/new-to-canada-car-buying-guide) or have owned a car for a while, these tips can help you keep your car running optimally.

## Maintain Your Tire Pressure

The main reason for car care is to keep your vehicle safe. Basic tire maintenance can help prevent tire-related accidents. Check your tire inflation at least monthly, even if your vehicle has automatic pressure sensors. Front wheels are used for steering, while the rear wheels remain relatively stationary, causing a variation in wear and tear. Routine tire rotation is essential to balance the wear in your tires.

## Change and Check the Oil Regularly

Motor oil must remain fresh, and it should be changed when it becomes degraded. Oil degrades from pressure, heat, and the collection of harmful particles. It typically breaks down with time, even if your car remains parked. Check your oil level every month or whenever you fill your gas tank. The owner's manual recommends the best period interval to check the level and when oil changes are required.

## Fill Up Your Windshield Washer Fluid

Running out of the windscreen washer can be inconvenient, especially during winter. Salt and road grime can mess up the windscreen and cause poor visibility. The fluid helps your windshield wipers clean the windscreen. If you use DIY fixes to maintain your wipers, follow the manual instructions to locate the wiper fluid container.

## Check Your Radiator

A car engine has various moving parts that generate heat from friction. Although engine oil lubricates these moving parts, it does not overcome the excessive heat energy. The engine uses a coolant in the radiator to regulate its temperature. You must keep it full to cool the engine block and avoid problems like overheating and seizures.

## Inspect the Brakes

Brakes ensure driver and road-user safety, and regular inspections can help identify potential issues with the brake system. During an [inspection](https://ffun.com/vehicle-inspection), professionals check for wear and tear on the callipers, rotors, and brake pads. Squeaking noises during brake application indicate that the pads need to be replaced.

## Flush the Brake Fluid

Regular maintenance is essential for ensuring that your brakes remain in good condition. Moisture absorption by the braking fluid can result in corrosion and eventual brake failure. To prevent such issues, it is recommended to flush out and replace the fluid every two weeks. Additionally, leakages in the brake lines can reduce braking performance.

## Inspect the Battery

A car maintenance schedule should involve checking battery terminals and cables to ensure they are attached securely. Cracks and leaks in the car battery require professional solutions. Hire a technician to check the battery voltage and determine whether it needs charging or replacement.

## Professional Car Dealers in Canada

Prioritizing vehicle maintenance is essential for preserving the longevity and efficiency of your car's engine performance. Ensuring that you schedule regular oil changes and other necessary maintenance tasks at a trusted repair shop is crucial for maintaining the optimal performance of your vehicle.
