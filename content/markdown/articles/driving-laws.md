Becoming a better driver means constantly staying up to date on emerging laws and regulations and learning more about the current ones in place so that you can stay safe on the road. Some of these you will already be accustomed to as a Canadian (speed limits, seatbelt laws, etc.), while others might be fun facts you weren't aware of. Let's take a look at some of the driving laws and regulations across Canada that you should be aware of.

## 4 Facts About Driving Laws and Regulations Across Canada to Know

## You Can't Smoke in Most Provinces When Minors Are Present

Smoking is a trend that already seems to be on the decline as more people become aware of the health hazards. Still, there may be some who are accustomed to smoking in their motor vehicle. The problem? Provinces like Ontario, Manitoba, and Saskatchewan have banned smoking and even vaping in front of minors, making it an offence that can fetch you a decent fine if you decide to break the law.

## You Can't Turn Right on a Red Light in Montreal

This is a strange law that only applies to Montreal, but it's one that you should take note of if you ever find yourself there. Turning right at a red light will get you in serious trouble in Montreal, and some speculate that the ban on right turns in this capacity was implemented to protect pedestrians. Of course, beyond this, it's also made Montreal quite unique due to its strange law, which is something that they readily embrace.

## You Should Only Honk in the Event of an Emergency... Unless Otherwise Permitted

Most places allow cars to honk for whatever reason, generally when they're angry or they're trying to get someone's attention. However, if you live in Quebec, you know that doing so outside of using your horn to indicate an emergency can get you fined. That being said, this isn't the case across Canada. Places like Prince Edward Island require you to honk when you pass another motor vehicle. Put simply, driving laws and regulations will vary in different areas, which is why it's so important to pay attention to them!

## Canada Shares Many Similar Laws and Regulations with Other Countries

While laws may change a bit across provinces, you'll still find many similar elements of driving safety that you'd find in other countries. These common rules of the road include the need for seatbelts and even booster seats for younger children, speed limits that decrease that you move off of highways and onto roads, giving the right of way to pedestrians, requiring auto insurance of drivers, and beyond. Put simply, if you find yourself on Canadian roads and visit other countries, the many lessons you've learned securing your driver's license here will benefit you elsewhere.

The same applies to getting on the road, as [buying your own](https://blog.ffun.com/articles/can-i-buy-a-car-in-canada-as-a-non-resident/) car and [obtaining an auto loan](https://blog.ffun.com/articles/can-newcomers-to-canada-get-an-auto-loan/) may require you to have a [Canadian license](https://blog.ffun.com/articles/do-you-need-a-canadian-drivers-license-to-buy-a-car/), proof of work, proof of residence, and beyond. Canada wants to make sure everyone on the road is prepared to be there and able to drive safely, even if provincial laws may vary slightly.

Things in Canada can look different depending on where you go, which can include everything from road signs to basic traffic laws. Understanding how the driving experience varies can ensure you're safe no matter where you go. Ready to take to the road? Find the right vehicle for you at FFUN in Saskatoon, Saskatchewan!
