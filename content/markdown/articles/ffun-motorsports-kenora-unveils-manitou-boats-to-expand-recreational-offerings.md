## KENORA, Ontario, March 1, 2024 

FFUN Motorsports Kenora, a prominent retailer of recreational vehicles and equipment, is excited to announce the addition of Manitou boats to its product lineup. This expansion marks a significant milestone for the dealership and enhances its commitment to providing premier recreational options to the Kenora community and surrounding areas.

Since its acquisition by FFUN, the Kenora store has been recognized for its exceptional offerings in Ski-Doo, Sea-Doo, and Can-Am BRP products. Recognizing the immense potential to cater to the vibrant "lake life" culture in Kenora, FFUN Motorsports Kenora identified the need to incorporate a marine division into its portfolio.

Daniel Sibbick, General Manager of FFUN Motorsports Kenora, expressed enthusiasm about the latest addition, stating, "At FFUN Motorsports Kenora, we have a heavy focus on our consumer’s needs and community development. We love what we do and embrace our surroundings in this beautiful area around Lake of the Woods and NW Ontario. We are thrilled to provide consumers with top-notch service and top-of-the-line recreational products!"

Under the leadership of CEO Mark Loeppky, FFUN Motorsports Kenora has remained committed to fostering growth and innovation within its operations. The decision to expand into the marine market aligns seamlessly with the company's dedication to meeting evolving consumer demands and elevating the overall customer experience.

Speaking on behalf of FFUN Motorsports, CEO Mark Loeppky shared his excitement about the expansion, stating, "We are excited to introduce Manitou boats to our amazing customers in Kenora. This strategic move is a testament to our commitment to providing unparalleled recreational solutions and further solidifies our position as a premier destination for outdoor enthusiasts."

Over the past year, FFUN Motorsports Kenora has diligently worked on integrating the Manitou Pontoon line into its inventory. The dealership has made significant investments in enhancing its facilities, including a 4800 square foot footprint that will house a new repair facility, as well as a designated display area for the Manitou Pontoon boat.

Customers can anticipate the arrival of the Manitou line in early spring 2024, just in time for the upcoming boating season. With its reputation for quality craftsmanship and innovation, Manitou boats promise to deliver a one-of-a-kind on-water experience for boating enthusiasts across Kenora and beyond.
