On April 30th, we were able to show our appreciation to the health care workers at the Jim Pattinson’s Children’s Hospital by providing every staff member with a complimentary beverage of their choice from Good Earth Coffeehouse!

Our team greatly respects the increased efforts that our healthcare workers have been putting in during this time of Coronavirus. We understand how difficult this has been, putting their families at additional risk and we extremely value health care’s sacrifice and hard work. We can’t thank the staff enough for the amazing care they provide to patients and families every day, and we hoped a free coffee would brighten up their day and bring some comfort during these times of increased stress.

This special offer was also made in celebration of the birth of a new baby in the FFUN family, and in honour of an employee who’s child is undergoing cancer treatments at JPCH.

Our team has been working hard to bring FFUN to life as much as possible in hopes to make a difference! Check us out on Instagram to see what we have been up to! @FfunGroup

Stay safe!
