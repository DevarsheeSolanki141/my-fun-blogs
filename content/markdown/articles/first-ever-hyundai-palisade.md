## Introducing the first-ever Palisade

The first-ever Palisade is the latest addition to our award-winning SUV lineup. Our flagship SUV features available 8-passenger premium seating space in an elegantly modern and intuitive interior that thinks about everyone in every row. With incredible convenience technologies at hand and a wealth of Hyundai SmartSense™ safety innovations, the 2020 Palisade is truly a remarkable SUV that is perfect for family life.

## The H-Factor

What is the H-Factor™? It means you can have it all. Our company believes in pushing the boundaries and challenging conventional thinking. Our very name, “Hyundai”, stands for modernity in the Korean language and it is this one word that helps represent everything we stand for. We don’t approach vehicle development in a traditional way. Our company is structured differently. We think differently. We find the modern way. It’s our mission to offer top quality, feature-rich vehicles at an affordable price. We offer elite quality through meticulous design and painstaking craftsmanship. Our three design centres in Korea, the U.S. and Europe compete against each other to bring you cutting-edge designs — designs that not only look stunning but are also aerodynamic and fuel efficient. We are the only global automaker to manufacture our own Advanced High-Strength Steel because, simply put, we just weren’t satisfied with what was available. We test our vehicles in areas like the Arctic, our proving grounds in the Mojave Desert and on Germany’s world-famous Nürburgring circuit to deliver the durability and reliability you demand. And not only do we package our vehicles with advanced safety and technology, we back all our vehicles with one of the best automotive warranties in the industry. This means you really can have it all, quality and value together. That’s the H-Factor™

## Explore with confidence.

The Palisade proves itself to be a highly capable performer thanks to our available HTRAC™ All-Wheel Drive (AWD) system. With a quick turn of the drive mode selector dial, you can easily customize the traction distribution with HTRAC™ Intelligent Drive Modes and access the new Multi-terrain Control Modes for added confidence on specific types of terrain. Constantly monitoring multiple input signals processed over 100 times per second, the system will automatically redistribute wheel traction based on road conditions to help ensure absolute control.

## Take on every day in style.

No matter the busy day ahead, the versatile Palisade will get you through it all with elevated style. A dominant wide cascading grille and available 20″ alloy wheels emphasize the strength and luxurious quality that lies within. The signature composition of the LED daytime running lights and vertically stacked headlights make a striking statement and leave a lasting impression of our flagship SUV.

## Technology surrounds you.

**Apple CarPlay™∆, Android Auto™◊ and Bluetooth®** connections all come standard to make accessing your favourite smartphone apps and taking phone calls effortless. Available on Luxury and Ultimate models is up to two Bluetooth® device connections simultaneously, so one can be connected to take phone calls while another phone can be used for audio streaming. Whatever you play, everyone will enjoy a surround sound experience with the available premium harman/kardon® 630-watt audio system featuring 12 speakers. The available 10.25″ touch-screen display offers a built-in navigation system and a Surround View Monitor that displays a 360-degree view of the Palisade for added guidance when parking in tight spaces. Available technologies like the 12.3″ fully digital instrument cluster and windshield-projected Head-Up Display offer various information displays to command the road with confidence.

**Command the road in comfort.** No detail has been overlooked. Everything in the cabin is crafted with fine materials and designed for maximum comfort. A wealth of impressive features wrap you in ultimate luxury no matter where you’re seated. Sink into the bolstered front seats that feature available Nappa leather with premium quilted details. An available 12-way power driver’s seat lets you find the perfect position and support. Second-row passengers will appreciate the spacious design to stretch out and feel like first-class passengers with available features like heated and ventilated\* seats. Available second-row captain’s chairs further the luxury experience. Everyone will appreciate the available dual-panel power sunroof that brightens up the interior

**Thoughtful features throughout the cabin**. The Palisade does an exceptional job of accommodating everyone’s needs, starting with seven standard USB outlets dispersed throughout the cabin. Innovative rear air vents keep air flowing and allow rear passengers to select between a focused, partially diffused or fully diffused stream of air. Thanks to the available three-zone climate control, both the driver and front passenger can select their desired temperatures, as well as the second-row passengers. Easily communicate with those in the third-row with an available in-vehicle intercom system, or keep things extra quiet for sleeping children by setting the audio system to Quiet Mode to mute the rear speakers.

**Hyundai SmartSense**. Road-trip with confidence and peace of mind with the extensive list of Hyundai SmartSense™ safety technologies offered with the Palisade. Among them are two available features designed to reduce your blind spot area. First is the confidence-inspiring Blind View Monitor1 that streams a live visual of your blind spot directly in the gauge cluster to provide you with added perspective. The second is our innovative Blind-Spot Collision-Avoidance Assist2 system that not only uses radar to detect when a vehicle is in the driver’s blind spot, but will also help avoid a collision by gently applying brake power on the opposite tire to deter an unsafe lane change.
