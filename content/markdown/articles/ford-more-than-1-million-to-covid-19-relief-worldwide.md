- FORD EMPLOYEE DONATION MATCH PROGRAM CONTRIBUTES MORE THAN $1 MILLION TO
  COVID-19 RELIEF WORLDWIDE

- Ford Motor Company Fund’s COVID-19 Donation Match program helps 47 community
  organizations in 20 countries and 14 U.S. states

- Program surpassed its goal of $1 million, raising more than $633,000 in individual contributions that were matched by $500,000 from the Ford Fund – the philanthropic arm of Ford – and personal contributions from Executive Chairman Bill Ford

Donation match contributions prioritized hunger relief; Other areas of support included health, basic needs, education and virtual arts and culture initiatives

Ford Motor Company Fund today announced Ford employees, and others contributed $1,133,447 million to COVID-19 related relief efforts around the world, surpassing its goal.

The COVID-19 Donation Match Program was established in April to provide Ford employees, their families and friends a way to help fight the growing pandemic that kept them at home and unable to volunteer in traditional ways.

“Giving back is one of Ford’s key values and that is most exemplified in our employees,” said Bill Ford, executive chairman, Ford Motor Company. “We received so many requests from employees asking how they could help in the early days of the pandemic. The donation match program provided a meaningful way for employees to join the fight against COVID-19 – even at a time they could not physically be there to pitch in and help make a difference.”

Through the match program, 47 nonprofits and community groups in 20 countries and 14 U.S. states received funds donated by Ford employees and others that were then matched by $500,000 from the Ford Fund and personal contributions from Ford Motor Company Executive Chairman Bill Ford.

The donation match supported community projects in markets with significant coronavirus-related needs and a substantial number of Ford employees. Nearly one-third — 29% — of the funds went to hunger relief efforts. The next highest share, 24%, was earmarked for projects that met a blend of basic human needs – food, shelter and clothing. Educational efforts received 19% of the funds. Remaining donations supported health-related projects, along with efforts to keep arts programs alive virtually and preserve jobs at institutions that provide historical and cultural education.

“This pandemic has impacted every aspect of our daily life and put many nonprofit organizations at risk of being unable to serve their communities,” said Mary Culler, president, Ford Motor Company Fund. “Thanks to the generosity of our employees and others, we were able to support a wide range of projects around the world and continue the critically important work these nonprofits are doing.”

The program was administered by GlobalGiving, Ford’s longtime disaster relief and global grant-making partner.
