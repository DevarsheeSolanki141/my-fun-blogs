Genesis Saskatoon is the first dealership in Western Canada to receive the award for exceptional service from Forbes Travel Guide.

## TUESDAY, MAY 2, 2023 – SASKATOON, SK

Luxury car dealerships are now offering a premium customer experience similar to that found at five-star hotels and restaurants. Genesis Saskatoon, a prominent car dealership in Saskatchewan, has been commended for its exceptional service by Forbes Travel Guide, renowned for its evaluations of hotels, restaurants, and spas. This recognition marks a significant milestone as Genesis becomes the first automaker to be acknowledged by Forbes Travel Guide, a trusted authority in luxury hospitality for over six decades.

Being the first dealership in Western Canada and the second worldwide, Genesis Saskatoon joins the prestigious “In Partnership with Forbes Travel Guide” program. Genesis London in Ontario received this honour earlier this year. During the recognition event in Saskatoon, Eric Marshall, the director of Genesis Motors Canada, expressed their commitment to providing an outstanding experience for each guest, drawing parallels to the superior service guests receive at five-star hotels.

“As a motor group, our job is to offer vehicles while providing customers with incredible service. To be recognized with such a prestigious award by one of the most significant names (Forbes) is a true honour for myself, and the team at Genesis,” says Mark Loeppky, CEO of FFUN Group. “I am grateful to work alongside the team at Genesis Saskatoon and understand this partnership would not be possible without their unwavering commitment to provide exceptional service every day.”

Genesis aims to deliver a similar level of excellence when customers visit their dealerships for car purchases or servicing. Marshall believes that achieving recognition from Forbes Travel Guide presents a compelling business opportunity for other Genesis outlets. This partnership will facilitate engagements with potential customers who appreciate a luxury lifestyle.

Alexandra Miziolek, the manager of training and operational excellence at Genesis Motors Canada, explains that Forbes Travel Guide has established 189 guidelines for the dealership experience. These guidelines cover various aspects, such as ensuring customers’ vehicle settings are maintained during servicing and providing amenity applications to enhance the dealership visit. The amenities include a calming environment without disruptive announcements over the PA system, a pleasant fragrance, well-appointed washrooms, and serving complimentary coffee in china cups rather than paper cups. The program’s attention to detail (even) extends to remembering customers’ coffee preferences for their subsequent visits.

The evaluation criteria require a perfect score of 100 percent on six of the 189 guidelines. For the remaining 183 points, dealerships must achieve a minimum score of 75 percent. Genesis Saskatoon achieved an impressive 86 percent overall.

Miziolek emphasizes that the Forbes Travel Guide partnership involves a rigorous and comprehensive process. The dealership staff underwent training on luxury hospitality practices to meet the program’s exacting standards.

Hermann Elger, the CEO of Forbes Travel Guide, commends Genesis Motors Canada for its dedication to service excellence and highlights the organization’s commitment to collaborating with exemplary companies like Genesis.

While the evaluation process is demanding, the recognition is valid for one year, motivating the staff to sustain the high standards and undergo annual requalification to proudly maintain their status as a partner of Forbes Travel Guide.
