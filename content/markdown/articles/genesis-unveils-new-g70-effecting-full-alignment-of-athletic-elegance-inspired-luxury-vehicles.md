- The new Genesis G70 compact sport sedan strengthens Genesis’ brand identity,

aligning all existing models with current Athletic Elegance design philosophy

- New G70 enhances existing market-proven driving performance credentials and

leading safety features

- New G70 to be offered with standard all-wheel drive (AWD) in Canada, with

deliveries beginning in 2021

Genesis previewed the new Genesis G70 with a few images prior to start of sales which will happen first in Korea next month. Launched in 2017, with Canadian deliveries having begun in April 2018, the compact sport sedan has an athletic design, dynamic driving performance, and leading safety features. It attracted such achievements as the 2018 Good Design Award (Transportation Design Division), 2019 North American Car of the Year, and Top Safety Pick+ recognition from the U.S. Insurance Institute for Highway Safety (IIHS).

The new Genesis G70 features enhancements which focus on an athletic exterior design evolution, a driver-centred interior, and state-of-the-art technology update.

The signature Crest Grille, set even lower than the Quad Lamps which spread outward, evokes a sprinter’s pre-race posture and highlights the new Genesis G70’s position as the most athletic sport sedan in the Genesis lineup.

In profile, side air extractors, optimized for efficiency, show a form-follows-function mentality while the sensuous surface around the front wheels expresses the powerful muscles of a sport sedan.

Rearward, Quad Lamp taillights inspired by the soaring wings of the Genesis logo, clearly identify the distinctive Genesis aesthetic. The full width G-Matrix mesh and body-coloured diffuser surround the oval exhaust tips add finishing touches to the exterior design.

The interior leverages a driver-centred architecture resembling a fighter jet cockpit and adds the latest connectivity technologies. To provide a seamless user experience, a new 10.25-inch infotainment system features an exclusive Genesis user interface design supporting the latest over-the-air (OTA) wireless updates, and valet mode. In addition, the wireless charging system has been changed to a horizontal layout, increasing convenience for those with ever-changing smartphone sizes.

The new Genesis G70 will reach Canadian shores later in 2021, and will be offered in Canada with standard all-wheel drive (AWD).
