Winter has come and gone, so is driving around in the snow, ice, and slush. This means summer, windows down driving is just around the corner and it’s the perfect time to take some key steps to ensure that your car is in top condition for the warmer months. Below are twelve tips to get your car ready for smooth sailing all Spring:

1. Have your car thoroughly washed:
   Of course, you must have been washing your car during the winter months but this would be different. This time you need to have it deep cleaned, inside and out. This would remove the road salt, grime, and grit that may have attached to your car during the cold months.

2. Switch your tires from snow tires to all-season or summer tires:
   Tires built for winter are made from a softer rubber, which allows them to stay flexible during the cold months. If used during summer, they tend to wear away quickly. Therefore, it is advisable you switch your tires from winter tires to all-season or summer tires.

3. Consider changing your wiper blades:
   Just like tires, some wipers are designed specifically for winter. These wiper blades are built from a different type of rubber as compared to their summer counterparts. If you happen to be using such type of wiper blade, then you should consider changing it as the weather begins to warm up. Even if your wiper blades aren’t built particularly for winter, it is advisable you inspect them and try to have it changed if it is no longer doing its job.

4. Test your air conditioning:
   This is of tremendous importance as you wouldn’t want to drive around in a car without air conditioning on a hot day. Not only will it be very uncomfortable, but it can also be quite dangerous. Before the weather gets too warm, it is expected that you test you’re a/C to be sure it is in good condition. If you hear strange noises when you put it on or the air seems warmer than it should be then you should have a professional take a look at it.

5. Check your brakes:
   The winter months tend to cause motorists to use their brakes more as the traffic is slower, plus all the stop-and-go action. Therefore, it is important to have your brakes checked before the summer months. You can ask your mechanic to check it for you as you remove your winter tires.

6. Keep your coolant cool:
   Your coolants are going to be extremely important for the coming warm months so it is important you check their level and ensure that the mixture of chemicals is correct. This can be done using a coolant tester available in your local auto parts store or you can have it checked by a professional if you are not a technical person.

7. Check your wiper fluid level:
   People tend to use more wiper fluid during winter than in summer or spring. You can ensure that your windshield remains clean by filling the reservoir with either water or the blue fluid usually sold at a big box or auto parts store. This fluid would do a better job at keeping your shield clean.

8. Clean your floor mats:
   It is common for car owners to opt for synthetic rubber mats as they are specially built to withstand the rigors of tough weather. At the height of winter, the last thing on your mind will be to clean your floor mats, hence permitting the buildup of dirt. Summer gives you the opportunity to have these mats thoroughly washed. And if there is the need, have them replaced entirely.

9. Check your emergency gear:
   The cold months are over, so you won’t be needing a blanket or parka anymore. Instead, check to confirm that the batteries of your flashlight are still good and that you have a few bottles of water in your vehicle. Also, if you happened to have to resort to using flares during the winter months, now is the time to have those replaced. You should also check to confirm that all the components of your tire jack are present in the car.

10. Check your technology:
    You should also take the time to assess the technology of your vehicle. For those with an older vehicle, you should check to see what aftermarket technology is available for the improvement of your system. While for those with a newer model, you can confirm from your dealer that your tech and software are up to date.

11. Consult your maintenance schedule:
    It is expected that you service your car regularly. The period before the arrival of summer is excellent to bring out the owner’s manual to see what your vehicle is due for, considering the mileage on the odometer.

12. Check your power steering fluid:
    Most garages won’t bother to check this, but it is equally important. Having a low level can make it difficult to steer the wheels, while dirty fluid can damage the entire system. The car manual can give relevant pointers on how to check the fluid level.

With the sun shining, the last thing you want to be doing this Spring is be stuck standing on the side of a road because you missed some simple maintenance. Take the time to get your vehicle prepped, or better yet, let us do it for you at the FFUN Motor Group.
