We are proud to introduce the Jeep Gladiator Mojave! Conquering new territory once again, the Jeep brand earns North American Truck of the Year title in its debut year! Judged by a respected panel of 50 automotive journalists from across the U.S and Canada, the North American Car, Utility and Truck of the Year. (NACTOY) awards are among the most prestigious in the industry.

To earn a NACTOY award, a vehicle must lead its class in several key areas, including innovation, design, safety, handling, driver satisfaction and value. The 2020 Jeep Gladiator excelled in all these areas, conquering new automotive territory in the process.

## NACTOY##

The NACTOY awards recognize the most outstanding new vehicles of the year. These vehicles are benchmarks in their segments based on factors including innovation, design, safety, handling, driver satisfaction and value for the dollar. The organization gives out three awards. They are: “North American Car of the Year,” “North American Utility of the Year,” and “North American Truck of the Year.” The awards are unique because – instead of being given by a single publication website, radio or television station – they are given by an independent jury of automotive journalists from the United States and Canada.

## A Pickup Only Jeep Could Build##

Nothing compares to the jeep Gladiator’s unique blend off 4×4 capability and pickup truck functionality.

“The Gladiator exists in its own class,” noted one NACTOY jury member. “Its rugged styling and go-anywhere capability, combined with the utility of a pickup truck makes it a breakthrough product.”

As one NACTOY member summed up, the Jeep Gladiator is “the most interesting new vehicle in a long while. Simultaneously a pickup, a 4-door convertible and an off-roader.”

The Jeep Gladiator opens up a whole new world of possibilities, completely re-defining what a pickup can be and do.

## The Best Pick in Pickups##

From hitting trails to hauling trailers, the Jeep Gladiator is ready for every adventure and activity.

“Right out of the box, the Gladiator is the most capable midsize pickup truck ever conceived and executed,” praised the NACTOY jury. “The Gladiator fully delivers in traditional truck areas, like payload and towing, while over-delivering in the areas of off-road adventures and practical innovation.”

In fact, the Jeep Gladiator can tow up to 3,470 kg (7,650 lb) and haul up to 726 kg (1,600 lb). With real-truck capability like that, the Gladiator represents innovative thinking and design, creating a one-of-a-kind choice in the pickup market.

## Oasis from the Elements##

Sit back and really enjoy the drive thanks to the many thoughtful touches designed into the Gladiator cabin.

Features like the weatherproof push-button, available Uconnect 4C NAV multimedia centre with Largest-in-Class 8.4-inch touchscreen and premium navigation, and available heated, leather-faced front seats place the Gladiator in a class of its own. Passengers will appreciate the Best-in-Class rear seat legroom and clever storage solitons add convenience to every drive.
