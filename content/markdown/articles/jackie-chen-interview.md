Three years ago, Jackie Chen made the bold decision to move from China to Canada, seeking new opportunities and experiences. Eager to start his career in a new country, Jackie sent his resume to multiple dealerships. His perseverance paid off when Walid, the General Manager of Acura Centre, reached out to him. With a work visa in hand and a passion for the automotive industry, Jackie joined the Acura Centre team. Over the past two years, he has become an invaluable member of the group, bringing his dedication and expertise to every customer interaction.

## 1- WHERE ARE YOU ORIGINALLY FROM?
Jackie moved to Canada three years ago from Shandong, a province in China. 

## 2- WHAT ARE YOUR HOBBIES?
Jackie has a passion for cars, especially those with big engines and modifications. Before he got married, he owned several vehicles that he enjoyed customizing and enhancing for performance. Since getting married, he's opted for a more practical SUV, but his love for cars remains strong.
In addition to his interest in cars, Jackie enjoys playing games across various platforms, including PlayStation, computers, and his phone. Gaming is one of his favourite ways to unwind and have fun.

## 3- WHAT WAS THE LAST VACATION YOU TOOK?
Jackie's last vacation was just last month when he went to Waskesiu Lake. He enjoyed a relaxing time there, appreciating the peace and quiet, which allowed him to unwind and truly chill out.

## 4- DO YOU REMEMBER WHAT THE LAST GIFT WAS THAT YOU GAVE SOMEONE?
Six months ago, Jackie gave his wife an Acura RDX as a gift. We can all agree that's a pretty amazing present. 

## 5- HOW WOULD YOU SPEND $1 MILLION?
Jackie would use $1 million to buy a house with a walkout basement and a three-car garage. The spacious garage would be perfect for him to continue his hobbies with cars.

## 6- DO YOU HAVE A FAVOURITE EMOJI?
Jackie's favourite emoji is the puppy. His wife affectionately calls him 'puppy' because when they first met when he was 16 years old, she saw him as a lively and endearing young puppy at the time.

## 7- DO YOU PREFER SWEET OR SAVOURY FOODS? WHAT’S YOUR FAVE?
Jackie prefers savoury foods over sweet ones, particularly Chinese hot pot.

## 8- WHAT WAS THE MAKE AND MODEL OF YOUR FIRST CAR?
Jackie’s first vehicle was a BMW 645Ci

## 9- DO YOU LIKE CITIES OR REMOTE PLACES?
Jackie prefers cities similar to Saskatoon—places that are not too large like Vancouver or Calgary, but also not as small as some of the more remote towns in Saskatchewan. He enjoys the balance of having enough amenities and activities without the overwhelming hustle and bustle of a big city.

## 10- WHAT DO YOU LOVE ABOUT FFUN?
Jackie appreciates FFUN Group's commitment to providing equal opportunities for career advancement, regardless of seniority. He values the supportive environment where managers genuinely care about their team members as friends, not just as employees. Jackie finds that the sense of camaraderie extends beyond the workplace, fostering a family-like atmosphere where colleagues bond over shared interests, whether it's grabbing a drink after work, gathering at each other's homes, or enjoying games together. This inclusive culture not only encourages professional growth but also builds lasting personal connections among coworkers.

## 11- WHAT DOES LET’S GO MEAN TO YOU?
Jackie views 'Let's Go' as more than just a phrase—it's a guiding principle. To him, it signifies continuous movement and proactive action. In his perspective, simply showing up without purpose accomplishes nothing; progress requires setting goals and relentlessly pursuing them.
