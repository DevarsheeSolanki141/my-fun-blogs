- kia Canada experiences YOY growth in every region, led by Quebec, up 69% YOY amid challenging times in the industry
  July 2, 2020 – Amid a turbulent and declining market, Kia Canada is proud to have achieved their best month ever in its over 20-year history in Canada. Up 7% over June last year, Canadians continue to embrace Kia with 8,647 units sold, following an inspiring month of May with 5,904 units. In addition to this national milestone for June, Quebec saw a 54% increase YOY.

With only 60 days in market, the all-new Kia Seltos has rapidly won over the hearts of Canadians by taking the second place position in Kia’s overall sales, with 2,670 units sold combined May and June. Seltos has established itself as a compelling addition to the Kia line up, contributing confidently to Kia sales since launch. Notably, Seltos secured the number one spot in Quebec during its first month of sales in May with 542 units.

June saw another landmark for Kia as it maintained the honour of being the #1 mass-market brand for the sixth consecutive year for J.D. Power’s Initial Quality Study (IQS) award in the US. This, coupled with the all-new Kia Telluride winning Best Large Utility Vehicle in Canada for 2020 by AJAC, on top of AJAC’s 2019 Canadian Car of the Year award for the Stinger, Canadians are truly recognizing Kia’s ‘Power to Surprise’ and are responding with incredible support for the brand. “We are so pleased to see these strong sales figures persist throughout June, and we have high hopes for July performance as well,” says Elias El-Achhab, Chief Operating Officer at Kia Canada. “The success Kia Canada is seeing is a reflection of Canadians’ desire for uncompromising quality, leading design and innovative technology.”

Throughout May and June, Kia continued the brand’s “Kia Has You Covered” promotion, in which Kia paid, not deferred, the first six months’ of payment on finance and the first 3 months’ payment on leases on some of their most popular models. A revised version of this promotion will continue throughout the month of July on Sorento, Forte Sedan and Forte5 models. In addition, strong financing offers of 0%/84 months on 2020 Sorento, Soul, Sportage, Optima and Stinger will be featured.
