Is it time to upgrade and walk out of a dealership with a [shiny new vehicle](https://ffun.com/search-vehicles)? If you are looking at trading your vehicle for a new car, it's important to make sure you maximize your trade-in value. The amount you get your used car will likely influence your next car loan. A higher trade-in value will mean a lower down payment. Here are a few things to know about trade-in offers to ensure you get the best price.

## What Hurts a Trade-In Offer?

One of the best ways to learn about what maximizes your used car [trade-in value](https://ffun.com/trade-in) is by learning about what hurts its valuation. Obvious things such as accidents and mileage both play a large role in the trade-in value, but so do things such as odours, smoke, dents, mechanical issues, and scratches or cracks on the vehicle's interior. While you won't see these things noted on Edmunds, they will decrease the value of your car so it can pay to have your car professionally detailed in Canada before bringing it to the dealership.

## Know Your Market Value

Dealerships are looking to make a profit too, so before you bring your old car down to a dealership, take some time to look up the trade-in value of your car online. There are many free value range calculators online that take into account things like odometer, make, model, and year of the automotive. Car dealerships have their own similar version, so make sure you know the bottom line before you start negotiating to make sure you get the best trade value.

## Take Care of Minor Repairs Before Going to Car Dealers

While it's true you can still sell your car to FFUN in Saskatoon with minor dents, you may get a bit more for your money if you take care of easy fixes and small scratches before you start looking for your next car. Small dings can be buffed out and things like broken taillights are hassle-free fixes. Also, make sure you put together a history report for your vehicle that shows you kept up with maintenance. Regular oil changes are one small thing that can help boost your resale price.

## Clean Your Car: Vacuuming and Washing

While this should be a given, make sure you thoroughly clean your car before to the dealership. How a car looks is important, especially when a salesperson considers how attractive your used car will look to potential buyers. Wash the floor mats, vacuum all the seats, and take the car through a car wash that includes tire cleaning before heading down to the dealer and you may just bump up the value of your vehicle.
