Aleesha Dirks has been part of the FFUN family for nearly three years, showcasing her versatility and dedication across various roles. She began as a receptionist at Acura, where her amazing organizational skills and warm demeanor quickly made her a standout team member. Recognizing her potential, Rob extended an offer for Aleesha to step into the role of Experience Manager at Genesis. This opportunity allowed her to hone her skills in customer service and management, setting the stage for her next career move. Driven by a passion for the automotive industry, Aleesha moved to North Hyundai to become a Service Advisor. In this role, she continues to provide outstanding service and support, helping customers maintain and enhance their driving experience.


## 1.WHERE ARE YOU ORIGINALLY FROM?

Aleesha is originally from Cardon, SK. She misses the charm of small-town life, where she grew up as a farm kid but enjoys returning to her hometown, where she can be part of the simplicity and close-knit community of her roots.

## 2.WHAT ARE YOU KNOWN FOR?

Aleesha admits that she is most likely known for being energetic and happy all the time; two amazing qualities that make her incredibly enjoyable to be around. 

## 3.WHAT ARE YOUR TOP TWO BUCKET LIST ITEMS? 

Often when asked this question, people struggle to find a response - not Aleesha. Her number one dream (bucket list item) is to travel to Italy, particularly the wine regions, purely driven by her love for wine, and of course the beautiful scenery. 


Her second bucket list item is to visit Disneyland Paris. After seeing Disneyworld in Florida it has sparked her interest to see other parks. On a sentimental notes, she (sadly) lost a friend who loved Disney, and visiting the various parks is a nice reminder of the memory of her friend. 


## 4.WHAT’S ONE OF THE COOLEST THINGS YOU’VE EVER SEEN OR DONE?

Without a doubt, one of the coolest places Aleesha has visited was England during a trip in her grade 12 year. What made this trip one of the most fun and wildest experiences was that she got to see Prince William and Kate get married. 

## 5.DO YOU HAVE A FAVOURITE HOLIDAY?

Aleesha's favourite holiday is Christmas. She cherishes family time, enjoys indulging in delicious food, and loves reconnecting with relatives she hasn't seen in a while. Plus, (she laughs) enjoys the bonus of having many days off work.

## 6.WHAT IS YOUR FAVOURITE FOOD?

This wasn’t an easy answer, as she says there are so many. In the end Aleesha landed on sushi being her favourite food, but only when the fish is raw.

## 7.IF YOU COULD HAVE ONE SUPERPOWER, WHAT WOULD IT BE?

Aleesha fully admits that she would like the ability to read people’s minds as it would make her job in customer service way easier - not having to wait for customers to answer.  

## 8.WHAT WAS THE MAKE AND MODEL OF YOUR FIRST CAR?

An incredibly quick response, Aleesha loved her first car which was a 2021 Saturn SC2. She says it was a manual transmission, fast, and great on gas.

## 9.HOW LONG WOULD YOU SURVIVE A ZOMBIE APOCALYPSE?

We definitely got Aleesha laughing at this one. Sadly she says she would (only) last five minutes as she can’t run very fast and would be the slowest of anyone around her. 

## 10.DO YOU LIKE CITIES OR REMOTE PLACES BETTER?

Aleesha finds cities too busy and full of traffic and therefore, prefers remote places. For her, they are peaceful, calmer, and much easier to get around in. 

## 11.DO YOU HAVE A FAVOURITE MEMORY?

Aleesha's favourite memory is the birth of her three children. Though it was painful, for her it was also beautiful; the immense joy she felt made it all worthwhile. She wouldn't change it for the world, cherishing those moments as her most treasured experiences.

## 12.WHAT DO YOU LOVE ABOUT FFUN?

Aleesha loves that FFUN is family-oriented. For example, if something happens with her kids, the managers are really good about letting her deal with it. She appreciates how family-driven the environment is, making her feel supported both at work and at home. Aleesha finds it heartwarming that her workplace values family as much as she does.

## 13.WHAT DOES LET’S GO MEAN TO YOU?

For Aleesha, “Let’s Go” is simple - to her, it means let’s move forward, not think about the past and just keep going.
