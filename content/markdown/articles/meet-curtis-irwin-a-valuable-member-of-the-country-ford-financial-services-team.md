It’s time to meet a longstanding member of the Financial Services team at Country Ford, Curtis Irwin, who has been with them for almost two decades. It’s employees like Curtis that contribute to making FFUN such a great place and it’s time that we sat down with him to get to know him beyond his time spent at the dealership.

Curtis’s journey began before the FFUN group took over and his tenure at Country Ford started in sales, mastering the art of helping customers find their dream vehicle. But as they say, change is the only constant, and in 2012, FFUN rolled into town. It was then that Curtis decided to switch gears and transitioned into the world of finance.

Join us as we get to know Curtis Irwin, the man who’s seen Country Ford evolve and grow, and who’s been a crucial part of its story for nearly two decades. So grab a seat, get cozy, and let’s dive into Curtis’s journey at Country Ford.
