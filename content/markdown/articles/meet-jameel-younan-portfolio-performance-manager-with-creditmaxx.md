This month we had a chance to sit down with him to learn a bit about him outside of work. Jameel has just celebrated his one-year anniversary with CreditMaxx and according to Kevin, VP of FFUN Financial, who nominated him, he has worked in all facets of the portfolio successfully. Jameel started as an Account Manager, where he worked for six months, then became an adjudicator for the next three months, and is now sitting in the role of Portfolio Performance Manager.

#### **1. WHERE ARE YOU ORIGINALLY FROM?**

Jameel, originally from Baghdad, Iraq, immigrate to Canada in 2011. He initially moved to Syria as a refugee after the war, where he lived from 2006-2010, before coming to Canada.

#### **2. WHAT ARE YOU KNOWN FOR?**

Jameel, bashfully (yet proudly) feels he is known for being nice and always willing to help anyone, no matter the situation.

#### **3. WHAT ARE YOUR TOP TWO BUCKET LIST ITEMS?**

For Jameel, family is number one, and although it is not what most people consider a “bucket list” item, his would be to take care of his family. Beyond checking that off the list, he would like to visit the Wonders of the World, and his third bucket list item is to visit a vineyard in Tuscany, Italy where he can enjoy wine and cheese.

#### **4. DO YOU HAVE A FAVOURITE VACATION SPOT?**

Naming Jameel’s favourite vacation spot was easy for him. Without a doubt, he says, Cancun. He loves that he can wind down, relax, and leave everyday life behind.

#### **5. DESCRIBE YOURSELF IN ONE WORD**

Humble. Yes, we agree with that, too.

#### **6. IF YOU COULD HAVE DINNER WITH ANYONE – DEAD OR ALIVE, WHO WOULD IT BE?**

Back to family being number one to Jameel, if he could have dinner with anyone, it would be his Uncle Akrm who has passed away. He always looked up to him as an amazing human and Jameel tries to live up to the man he was.

#### **7. IS THERE SOMETHING YOU ALWAYS FIND YOURSELF SAYING?**

When asked this, Jameel laughed and responded with, “you are correct.” He admits that he rarely uses replacement phrases such as, “yes,” “that’s right,” or just “correct.” He typically goes with, “you are correct.”

#### **8. WHAT IS YOUR FAVOURITE FOOD?**

Another easy one for Jameel to answer; his favourite food is Dolma, similar to Greek Dolmades, which are grape leaves filled with rice and other stuffings.

#### **9. IF YOU COULD HAVE ONE SUPERPOWER, WHAT WOULD IT BE?**

Jameel is fascinated by people and always tries to understand them, so for him, having the superpower to read minds would be the ultimate.

#### **10. IF A MOVIE WAS MADE AFTER YOU, WHO WOULD YOU WANT TO PLAY YOU?**

With a love for movies and Hollywood stars, Jameel appreciates the humility and personalities of some of them. For that reason, it’s a no-brainer that he would want Keanu Reeves to play him.
