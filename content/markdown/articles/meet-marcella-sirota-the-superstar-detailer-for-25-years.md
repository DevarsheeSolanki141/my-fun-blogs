If there is a team member who exemplifies the FFUN Core Values, it’s Marcella. She just celebrated 25 years with Acura Centre and is the model for Team Player and Down to Earth. Marcella works as a detailer with FFUN and is known as the “mom” of the group who takes extreme pride in her work and her workplace. She is described as being a task-focused person who takes initiative and is constantly busy. We’ve sat down with her to ask some FFUN questions for all of us to get to know her better.
