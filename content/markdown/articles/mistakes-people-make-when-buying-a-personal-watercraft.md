Buying a personal watercraft can feel a lot like buying a new house or a new car; there is a lot of excitement in the air and you just can’t wait to complete the purchase and take your newest toy for a ride. But it is important that you keep your emotions in check so you can use your head to make a right purchasing decision. Quite often people allow the rave of the moment cloud their better judgment, only for them to encounter complications days or a few weeks after purchase. Below are seven common mistakes that people make when buying a personal watercraft;

1. Assume it is like buying a car:
   Of course, the excitement of buying both may be similar, but not the cost and experience associated with each. While a car dealership can still sell a car to you at dealer invoice and still yet make a profit, this is impossible for a personal watercraft dealership.

One of the major reasons behind this is that a car is shipped ready to go, aside from taking out some cosmetic parts. But when it comes to Sea-Doo, these machines are shipped in crates due to a need for compression. This means the dealership will have to pay for re-assembling. Aside from that, most ski manufacturers don’t ship with batteries. And even if they do, it mostly doesn’t contain fluid nor is it charged to go. An average to good battery goes for around $165.

All of the above, in addition to shipping cost, which the dealership may include, makes the experience and cost somewhat different.

2. Assume dealers enjoy excellent markups:
   It is not unusual for people to assume that personal watercraft dealers enjoy excellent markup. After all, we live in a world where some retail outlet offers as much as 80% off. Although there is absolutely nothing wrong with taking advantage of a great deal, the only problem here is that such deals tend to tint the perception of many people, making them assume that everything, particularly luxury items, has at least a 40% markup.

It is important to know that not everything has an excellent markup. In fact, some jet skis only enjoy a $200 markup while it may cost as much as $400 to have it shipped. It is impractical to run a dealership with $200 when you have to pay $400 to have the machinery shipped. The only way the dealership can compensate is by charging freight.

3. Not considering future needs:
   The failure to think ahead is another mistake people make when buying a personal watercraft. If you have kids then it is sensible to put into account how you will want to use it was your kids grow up. To be on the safe side, it is better you assume that you will expand the use of your watercraft in the years ahead. Depending on the activities that you fancy most, buy something that can handle those activities. Boats or Sea-Doos are typically designed for specific purposes, so it would be a huge error to buy a ski boat if your plan is to go fishing.

4. Opt for something smaller:
   It is not uncommon for people to opt for the base unit to fulfill their basic needs for watercraft ownership. The challenge with this, however, is that after a short time, most people outgrow their choice and desire a bigger one. At this point, the most sensible thing to do will be to exchange the old watercraft for a newer, bigger one. But this would still mean paying a sales commission. If you can afford it, a better option will be to get the best personal watercraft for your buck, right off the hop.

5. Not doing adequate research:
   Before you proceed to make payment for anything, anything at all, it is wise that you carry out proper research. This would save you a tremendous headache in the future. This is particularly important when it comes to buying a boat or any other form of watercraft. The process of purchasing these types of pleasure crafts can sometimes be more complex than even buying a house. Visit watercraft review websites and find out what experts have to say about the different water vessels and the experience other people have about using them. An informed customer is less likely to fall into error than an ignorant one.

6. Taking advice from wrong sources:
   Although it is important to carry out proper research before proceeding to purchase, you must be careful about the negative comments you find online. In a lot of cases, these comments come from writers who have issues with the dealer or the brand and have decided to take their displeasure on the product. In some cases, these comments come from boat or engine dealers against a competitive brand.

7. The best place to buy a watercraft is at a Spring Show:
   Although there is some truth in this statement, there are other times and places where personal watercrafts can be purchased at better rates. For example, December is an excellent month to buy a boat or watercraft as dealers typically want to get these off their books and bank their floor plan at the end of the calendar year. June and July are also good months to make purchases.
