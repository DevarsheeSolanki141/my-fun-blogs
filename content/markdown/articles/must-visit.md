Canada, known for its vast size and extensive coastline, offers an ideal setting for embarking on epic road trips. Some of the best road trips in the country will take you through the Rocky Mountains and other areas filled with natural beauty. Here are some of the destinations to visit for an [unforgettable experience](https://blog.ffun.com/articles/find-your-freedom-in-every-season/).

## Banff

Southern Alberta is home to the oldest and first National Park in the country, making it a significant landmark in Canada's conservation history. It features abundant wildlife, rivers, waterfalls, lakes, tremendous forests, and canyons. Its altitude supports three ecoregions: subalpine, alpine, and montane. Exploring the area will give you sightings of wolverines, moose, caribou, wolves, and red foxes.

## Jasper

This is a UNESCO World Heritage Site. It is the largest Canadian park and spans vast valleys, alpine meadows, and wild rivers. It harbours spectacular mountain drives and hiking trails for an epic road trip. Visiting the area allows you to enjoy the Sunwapta Falls and the scenic beauty of Mount Edith Cavell. You can also take a relaxing soak in Miette Hot Springs.

## Vancouver Island

This must-visit island welcomes you with a milder climate than the mainland. The island ranges, with the highest point being the Golden Hinde, are revealed as you explore deeper. This peak is located in the Strathcona Provincial Park, with glaciers like the Comox glacier. If you want to visit Vancouver on a day trip, you can use Victoria's express coach service.

## Cape Breton

This island in Nova Scotia is known for its flourishing Celtic culture and traditional fiddle music. The most common way to get to the Island by car is through the country's major highway. The cape is approximately 16 hours from New York City. This offers a great opportunity for a road adventure before getting to the main adventure destination.

## Tips for Travelling by Car

Road trippers can make the most of their experiences by adequately preparing before the trip. Creating a comprehensive bucket list requires a little research. Before hitting the road, you must plan your route and road trip itinerary. Here are some [tips](https://blog.ffun.com/articles/get-your-car-ready-for-spring/) to elevate your open-road experience:

## Plan Early Enough

Early planning allows you to organize the perfect getaway for a world-class trip. If you visit areas like national parks, you must book campgrounds in advance. Securing a place prior will ensure you have a spot to relax and recollect yourselves.

## Utilize Planning Tools

Travellers can use guidebooks and apps to plan trips. Google Maps provides convenient directions to any destination, providing visual cues and voice instructions. On your scenic drives, you can use Waze to get traffic and road condition updates and Hotel Tonight for lodging deals.

## Plan For Side Trips

Focusing on a particular destination can prevent you from exploring roadside attractions. Along your route, you can visit historical sites like the Quebec Citadel and other areas. You can use these stops to rest and explore simultaneously.

## Reliable Long-Distance Vehicles

Getting a reliable car for your trip reduces the risk of a roadside emergency. You will need a trusted mechanic to examine your vehicle before exploring the Canadian natural wonders.
