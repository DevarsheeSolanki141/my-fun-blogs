## To Our Valued Customers

Amid ongoing concerns about COVID-19, we want to explain what we are doing here at the FFUN Group in response to the situation to ensure our dealerships are safe for you, our customers and employees. We realize at this point you’ve likely received many similar emails, but we wouldn’t feel right not updating our FFUN family on the steps we’re taking with you in mind.

We want you to be safe and we want our team to be safe. To this effect, we have implemented several enhanced cleaning protocols at all locations effective immediately. This includes increasing the frequency of complete facility cleaning and on-going sanitization throughout the day, focusing on all high-use areas such as phones, desks, customer lounges and counter surfaces. We’ve also provided in-depth information to all staff about the virus, taking the necessary precautions in terms of customer interactions and practicing social distancing if even the slightest symptom does arise. We are dedicated to maintaining a vigilant approach to these protocols.

## In the meantime, if your vehicle requires service:

- We are continuing to offer pick-up and drop-off for service appointments.

- Our technicians are using and wearing additional protective materials when working on your vehicle.

- You have the option to handle all your service communications by text, email or phone.

- Can accept payment digitally or by phone.

## If you’re currently shopping for a vehicle, but unsure about coming to the dealership:

- We can provide all vehicle information, pricing and even credit approvals through text, email or phone.

- We’re readily available to bring test drives to your home. Our team is armed with hand sanitizer and disinfecting wipes to provide the safest environment for your experience.

- Purchased vehicles can be delivered right to your driveway, with all paperwork brought to you by our sales team.

- And if you’re looking to sell a car, you can send us photos digitally to get an evaluation or we can send a team member direct to you.

- Of course, you’re still welcome to come visit us at the dealership anytime, you can even keep the pen!

**All 27 of our FFUN locations remain fully operational and are prepared to service your ongoing vehicle needs during this challenging time.**

**If you have any questions or concerns related to your vehicle you can contact us in-person or virtually; via phone or text at 306-700-7371, live chat on ffunmotors.com or any dealer website or via email at info@ffun.com.**
