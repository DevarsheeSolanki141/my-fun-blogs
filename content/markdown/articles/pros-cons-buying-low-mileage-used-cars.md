Buying a lower mileage vehicle of your desired brand, such as Honda, Ford, Subaru, Toyota, or Hyundai, is a decision that requires careful consideration of a lot of things. A lower mileage car is a slightly used car that has spent fewer miles on the road. You need to check the used car's mileage, warranty, Carfax, maintenance history, and insurance costs before purchasing it. The low mileage vehicle has the following pros and cons that you should evaluate.

## Advantages of Buying a Low-Mileage Car
### Cheaper

Unlike new cars, used vehicles are cheaper when it comes to the initial price. The pre-owned vehicle has a lower price than a new vehicle because of depreciation that reduces its current market value. Before putting a price tag on the old car, the previous owner has to calculate the depreciating value over the years and subtract it from its original price.
Though cost-effective, it is wise to know the used car's rate of depreciation, maintenance costs, fuel efficiency, and Carfax details and review the [vehicle history report](https://ffun.com/search-vehicles) to evaluate if it is worth it.

### Reduced Insurance Costs

Getting a used car that has covered low miles on the road can attract lower insurance rates than a high-mileage car. Most insurance companies charge less insurance costs for old vehicles than new vehicles. With reduced insurance rates, the older car gets a lower resale value.

### Little Wear and Tear

Used cars that have covered low miles in their lifespan are more likely to have less wear. The low mileage vehicle with little to no worn-out parts is the best car buying decision because of its condition. It also implies the car has fewer mechanical issues than higher mileage cars.

### Existing and Extended Warranty

When buying used cars, there is a high possibility of an existing warranty coverage that guarantees you peace of mind. An extended warranty can cover all the damages and repair costs in the car, allowing you to save money.

## Cons of Buying Used Cars
### Limited Options

As much as the old cars are cost-effective, there is a disadvantage of few low mileage options. There are no brands or models to compare to like new cars that usually have many newer models and makes.

### Outdated Car Features

Car buyers in California considering pre-owned cars can get vehicles with outdated features. That is a limitation because most new vehicles have new advancements and accessories that increase their functionality, comfort, and convenience. You are likely to get a vehicle without advanced safety features.

### Possibility of Odometer Fraud
Some fraudulent pre-owned vehicle owners can play a trick on you if you check the used car alone without professional help, as they can use fake digital odometers to show the vehicle has a low mileage and yet it's of a higher mileage. In such a case, ask for extended periods for a proper evaluation of the vehicle with the help of an expert.
