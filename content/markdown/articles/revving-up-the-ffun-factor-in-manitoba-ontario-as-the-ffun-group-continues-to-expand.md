## WINNIPEG, Manitoba – July 19, 2023

The FFUN Group (“FFUN”) is now in Manitoba and continuing its growth in Ontario as it announced its acquisition of Enns Brothers, a John Deere agricultural equipment and outdoor recreational equipment dealer in Manitoba and NW Ontario. The official announcement came through today, that Enns entered into an agreement to sell its Recreational and Marine Products division, to FFUN Group, one of Canada’s fastest growing automotive and recreational dealerships.

This announcement represents the culmination of an extensive review of Enns Brothers’ business divisions and the markets they serve. The company has been a successful agricultural equipment dealer for more than 65 years in Manitoba. More than 15 years ago, they began heavily investing in growing their presence in the outdoor recreational products space and achieved success, with dedicated Rec product locations in Winnipeg and Kenora and 3 other locations selling both ag and rec products.

When the FFUN Group approached Enns Brothers, both groups quickly recognized their common values and similar approach to business. The benefits brought to the table by a fast-growing company that was already a leader in the Recreational Products space was immediately obvious to both parties. “It was clear to us that FFUN Group would be able to leverage their existing infrastructure and expertise to more rapidly achieve the potential of the Rec and Marine business in Manitoba and NW Ontario,” said Ray Bouchard, President, and CEO of Enns Brothers.

FFUN Group’s CEO fully agrees. “Our vision is to represent the coolest products, sold by the best people and backed by an unshakeable commitment to bringing fun to life for employees and customers,” explains FFUN Group CEO, Mark Loeppky. “Enns Brothers has a solid group of knowledgeable employees; high quality product lines and we share a commitment to customer service excellence. We know that the Enns Brothers Rec and Marine division will be a great fit for our company, and our existing line-up of BRP locations. We are very excited to welcome the employees to our team.”

“The FFUN Group checked all the boxes for us in terms of their knowledge of the industry, their drive for growth, customer support and the way that they treat their employees,” said Ray Bouchard. “We could not have found a better group to take the recreational products business to the next level in Manitoba and NW Ontario. We thank our loyal customer group for their business over the years and want to let them know that we have the utmost confidence in the FFUN Group’s ability to continue delivering value and making outdoor activities FUN, all year round.”

## Overview of the Transaction:

> Upon completion of the Transaction, FFUN Group will acquire ownership of the Enns Brothers Kenora and Winnipeg (Lagimodiere) recreational products locations.
> FFUN Group will open new locations in Portage and Headingly (Winnipeg West).
> Enns Brothers will continue to sell recreational products out of its Steinbach location, which is not part of the sale.
