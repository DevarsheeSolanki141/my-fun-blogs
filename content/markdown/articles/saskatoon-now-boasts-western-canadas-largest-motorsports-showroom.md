FFUN Motorsports is upping the recreation game with their new 41,000 sq ft location

## WEDNESDAY, APRIL 26, 2023 – SASKATOON, SK

The FFUN Motor Group is continuing its growth at Ignition Avenue on 71st street and Idylwyld in Saskatoon, Saskatchewan with the opening of the massive, all-new, FFUN Motorsports Saskatoon.

The new FFUN Motorsports Saskatoon features Western Canada’s largest motorsports and marine showroom at 41,000 square feet, complete with a full parts, apparel and accessories department, along with an industry-leading, drive-thru service department. The team is committed to providing customers with the same amazing BRP product line, consisting of Sea-Doo, Ski-Doo, Can-Am, Manitou and Alumacraft. As well as many other products and brands, such as Kawasaki, that we have all come to love.

“The opening of the new FFUN Motorsports is another step toward providing Saskatchewan and surrounding provinces access to the largest selection of vehicles, motorsports, and marine products in Canada. I am proud of the work we have done to make this a destination for the Prairies and recognize that we wouldn’t have the success we do without the support of our loyal customers,” says Mark Loeppky, CEO of FFUN Group.

FFUN Motorsports Saskatoon began serving power sports enthusiasts in 2012 when they acquired the rights to the BRP product line and renamed it FFUN Motorsports. Since that time, they have gone through a plethora of showroom and location upgrades to keep pace with their growing customer base. Now over a decade later, they’ve expanded their inventory and services to bring even more FFUN to Western Canada. The impressive showroom can be found at 141 Motor Way and is the fifth location to join the 30-acre motoring destination at Ignition Avenue, joining Saskatoon Volkswagen, Saskatoon North Hyundai, Saskatoon Genesis and Redline Harley Davidson which opened in November 2022. It has become the city’s second auto mall, in the north-end of Saskatoon and is well on its way to becoming a $125+ million investment into Saskatchewan.

The building officially opened on Monday, April 17th with a full Grand Opening planned during FFUN Group’s inaugural FFUN Fest event on June 16th and 17th, 2023. This will include formal ribbon cutting presentations and fun events for the whole family, from concerts to motorcycle stunt shows.

“I am excited for FFUN Motorsports to be part of Ignition Avenue with the other divisions of the FFUN Group. There is so much interest in this location and the new store is unlike anything else in the province. For anyone who loves to play outdoors, this is what you dream about,” says Trevor Madore, General Manager/Dealer Partner at FFUN Motorsports Saskatoon. “I am incredibly proud of this project and know our customers and all the new recreation fans we will see through these doors are going to love the experience.”
