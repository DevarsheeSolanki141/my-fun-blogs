Sheldon is no newbie to the automotive industry. He started working with car parts 18 years ago at Scott Campbell Dodge. Before that, he was in the farming business, dealing with parts for John Deere equipment, in which during that time, Sheldon learned a lot about managing inventory and helping customers.

He attended parts school at (what is now called) PolyTech. When he joined the car industry, he made it his mission to be great at managing parts. Over the years, Sheldon has been really important in making sure the parts department runs smoothly. He takes care of inventory, helps customers, and supports his team.

We sat down with Sheldon to learn more about him as a person, not just as a Parts Manager.

## 12.WHAT DOES LET’S GO MEAN TO YOU?
