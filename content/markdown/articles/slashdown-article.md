## Area Auto Shoppers Express Disbelief but Dealer Remains Optimistic As Saturday, May 11 Event Date Approaches

SASKATOON, SK – Rob Weber, VP of Operations with the FFUN Group today announced plans for a one-day sales event that will feature cars selling for as low as just $69. This incredible event is called the Incredible SLASHDOWN Event for the simple fact that the posted prices on every pre-owned vehicle will be slashed by $3,000 to $7,000, with some selling for as low as just $69! The one-day sales event is scheduled to take place this Saturday, May 11, with registration starting today and on Saturday at 9:00AM.

When asked what prompted the idea, Weber explained, “Due to an overstock of pre-owned inventory resulting from a surge of recent late model trade-ins, our inventory
levels have risen. To immediately reduce current inventory levels, we will be slashing posted prices by thousands for ONE day only. On Saturday May 11th, auto shoppers can expect vehicle prices to be slashed by $3000 to $7000 (i.e. vehicles marked at $20,000 could be slashed below $17,000) and of course, a few $5,000+ vehicles will slash down to the incredible price of just $69! We’re confident that everyone will get an amazing deal and have fun in the process!”

It couldn’t be easier to participate: Simply visit [https://slashdown.ffun.com](https://slashdown.ffun.com) between now and Saturday morning to register and get a sneak preview of the inventory, which will feature over 200 vehicles of many different makes and models. Weber encourages shoppers to come out during the week to get pre-registered and browse the inventory for the ideal model. He adds, ‘For those shoppers looking exclusively for the $69 cars, you better come early when the gates open, as an offer like this rarely happens.”

Clearly, this is no ordinary car sale, and everything about this event is designed for customers to have a great time and get a great deal. On Saturday, musical entertainment will be provided, and refreshments will be made available for all. Weber asserts, “Everyone will have a great time and buyers should drive off with a big smile on
their face, having saved thousands.” This SLASHDOWN event is the exact opposite of an
auction, where bidding drives prices up. Posted prices will be marked down ONE time to a Rock Bottom ‘wholesale level’ price that will delight auto buyers and eliminates any need to haggle. In short, this event will provide buyers with the perfect opportunity to purchase a quality used car at the lowest possible price.

There will be at least 2 vehicles selling for just $69 each. Customers simply sit in the vehicle of their choice and watch as the price is marked down by three to seven thousand dollars. This event will feature over 200 pre-owned cars, trucks, vans and sport utility vehicles, assuring shoppers an excellent selection of many different makes and models. Including Hyundai, Kia, VW, Chrysler, Dodge, Ram, Jeep, Ford, Chevrolet, Toyota, Honda and more. All vehicles will be on display at FFUN Cars Saskatoon with pre-registration beginning today.

On Saturday, May 11th, registration begins at 9:00AM and at approximately 10:30AM Saturday, gates will open, and prospective buyers will have been given a personalized pass allowing them to inspect the vehicles that interest them. At 11:00AM, the slashing starts. Slashed down prices will be posted on each vehicle, one vehicle at a time. Whoever is sitting behind the wheel of the vehicle when the price is slashed will be given the first opportunity to purchase the vehicle at that price. The person sitting in the passenger seat has second opportunity to purchase the vehicle at the slashed price if the customer in the driver seat passes. Those wishing to beat the rush should get pre-registered beginning today online at [https://slashdown.ffun.com](https://slashdown.ffun.com) or visit FFUN Cars Saskatoon, located at 2035 Idylwyld Drive North, Saskatoon, across from the Travelodge. Customers are encouraged to pre-register, come early, and bring any vehicle they're considering trading.
