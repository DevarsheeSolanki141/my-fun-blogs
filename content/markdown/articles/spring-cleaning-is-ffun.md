## Spring Cleaning is FFUN…##

Like it or not, spring cleaning is amongst us. We are hoping we had our last snow fall (knock on wood), which means we wont be stuck with brown, dirty vehicles for much longer.
Have no fear, sparkly clean vehicles is near!

If you care about your car (which we are guessing you do otherwise you wouldn’t be reading this right now), you probably want to make your vehicles life last as long as you can. Did you know the best way to prevent permanent damage is through regular cleaning and detailing? You spend a pretty penny on the vehicle you are driving, so why wouldn’t you take every step you can to keep its life thriving and not just surviving? Most of us dread the annual car clean, but there is really no better feeling than a clean car, inside and out. Today we will go over some tips that we recommend doing in order to feel fresh and fine for the sunny days coming up! Here is a check list for you for to go over that will make you and your vehicle happy on the road!

## 1.Music##

For most people, cleaning is not “FFUN” or it’s just simply hard to get into. First things first, turn some music on and turn it up! We promise this helps the process.

## 2.Remove all the Trash & Clutter##

If you are a busy person always on the go, then you probably have a few bags in hand, your breakfast, a coffee mug and maybe even a few kids. Your vehicle will most likely start collecting some wrappers, dirt, toys, and maybe a mug or two. Before you know it, you wonder how it got to that point in the first place. The best thing to do for spring cleaning is just EMPTY your vehicle completely. Yes- even the change and/or sunglasses in that small compartment, because you will be surprised how much dust is layered on the small surfaces. Once you empty your car, you can tackle the dust.

## 3.Vacuum the Interior##

You should brush off any dirt or dust on the surfaces of the interior your car. You want to make sure you hit all angles including the buttons, ventilation areas, the crevices of the seat cushions, and every other spot you can think of where dirt could wiggle its way in. Next, take a stiff brush and go over your mats and carpets to remove and loosen the dirt from the material (Don’t forget the trunk!). Then you vacuum the mats and carpets to leave your vehicle feeling refreshed and clean!

## 4.Wipe Down the Surfaces##

Grab yourself a clean microfiber cloth, as well as some all-purpose cleaner and go crazy! Start on the main surface around the steering wheel, radio etc. After you get the base of everything cleaned, work your way to the inside of the doors and then the area where the door shuts. When you are wiping, you should leave the dustiest area till the last step so we are not pushing excess dust around the vehicle.

## 5.Organize##

This is the step where you start to feel accomplished. Grab those sunglasses and the rest of the stuff you took out of your console and bring it back in. Go over the things you haven’t used in a while/what doesn’t need to be in your vehicle and keep it out. Start organizing where you would like everything and declutter as much as possible!

## 6.Wash the Exterior##

Now for the main event, the car wash! During this time, you will be spraying, tilting, bending, twisting and scrubbing—so if you need to stretch before hand, no judgement. Give your vehicle a rinse, a soap/scrub, a rinse again and a spotless rinse if that’s an option. Don’t forget about under the edges, the cracks, and the tire rims, because there will be winter grime that we can’t always see! As the Santa Clause Movie once said “Seeing isn’t believing, believing is seeing”. Remember that quote and we promise no dirt will get passed you!Side note- this is also a good time to check the tire pressure and tighten up anything that is loose.

## 7.Windows##

We clean our window last in order to prevent getting them dirty in the cleaning process. This step seems to be a job people like to avoid; but most of us can only handle those streaks, and kid handprints for so long. Grab some window cleaner and a microfiber cloth and spray and wipe down the inside and the outside. Move around to look at the glare in different angles to ensure you didn’t miss a spot.

## 8.Treat Yo Self##

Congratulations! Your sparkly, clean vehicle will be turning heads in no time! Now it’s time to treat yo self. Ice cream, burger, Margarita? What ever gets you going, get online and order away- you deserve it!
Please be mindful with everything that is going on, and making sure we are practicing social distancing, and following all health regulations!

We hope this will be helpful for your upcoming vehicle spring cleaning! If you have any questions at all, please give any of our dealerships a call! We will be waiting for your sparkling vehicle to arrive once we all get through these uncertain times. <3
