Any new car purchase can be intimidating, whether you are actually [buying a new car](https://ffun.com/search-vehicles) or just a used car that is new to you. Car prices and interest rates are enough to make car shopping terrifying, but not if you know how to shop and when to shop.

## Black Friday Sales in Canada

While traditionally an American holiday, most dealerships in Canada have adopted Black Friday sales in an attempt to lure potential buyers onto their car lot. The Christmas season is a great time to buy cars, and Black Friday now offers a giant push for the used car market to launch it through the winter months. Coincidently, most new cars debut on car lots during November, so the month is a great time to save money on last's year model which is now part of the used car market.

## Snag a Used Car from the Previous Year in November

As mentioned, there are tons of car deals to take advantage of in November because of the arrival of new vehicles at the end of the month. If you have a good credit score, then it's time to look at [financing options](https://ffun.com/ffun-cars-financing) and head down to FFUN in Saskatoon to see what car deals match your holiday needs. A simple trade-in might help you get the price you want in Canada.

## Take Advantage of Sales Quotas During Christmas

Many car dealerships have sales quotas that their salespeople have to meet during the holiday season, which is great news for car buyers because dealers will be more willing to agree to a lower price to seal the deal.

## Kick Off the New Year with Rebates and Incentives from the Dealership

The New Year is also a great time to look at rebates and incentives from dealers who are working hard to move their old inventory to make room for their fleet of vehicles. From deals on certified vehicles with clean Carfax reports to extended warranties that offer you peace of mind when buying a used car, there are plenty of great opportunities to take advantage of every time the seasons change.
