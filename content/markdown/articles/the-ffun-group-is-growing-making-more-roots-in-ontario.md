#### **LONDON, Ontario – June 21, 2022**

The FFUN Group (“FFUN”) is growing, continuing with its national expansion through its recent acquisition of Forest City Mazda from the Palladino Auto Group. Based out of London, Ontario, this Mazda dealership serves Strathroy, Dorchester, Port Stanley, St. Thomas, and the surrounding areas.

With a history planted in the auto industry dating back to 1974, the FFUN Group, based in Saskatoon, Saskatchewan, Canada, was established in 2003. In that short timeframe, it has become one of Canada’s largest and fastest-growing automotive groups, with operating divisions representing the automotive, recreational, financial and real estate sectors.

“One of our core values is to be driven to grow. We are excited about continuing our expansion into the Ontario automotive market and the opportunities it provides for our entire group,” says President & CEO Mark Loeppky. “This is a well-run dealership with strong management. With the integration of our FFUN initiatives, we feel we can deliver a truly incredible and differentiated customer experience in this market.”

The FFUN Group was founded with the goal of breaking the mould of a conventional automotive dealership group. This acquisition, effective June 16, 2022, will add the first Mazda store to an already impressive line-up of OEM offerings in Western Canada. This includes Hyundai, Kia, Acura, Volkswagen, Ford, Chrysler, Dodge, Jeep, Ram and Genesis locations. But what makes FFUN truly differentiated is its multitude of divisions, including a financial, insurance and warranty arm that will provide Forest City Mazda with expanded alternatives for their customers. This divisional crossover provides a holistic buying experience, regardless of the motorized vehicle they are searching for.

FFUN owns and operates numerous independent, used retail stores across Canada, a collision centre, and an entire recreation division. Offering BRP (Ski-Doo, Sea-Doo, Can-Am), Lynx, Alumacraft, Manitou, Yamaha, Lund, RVs, and Harley Davidson products. This isn’t the first endeavour for FFUN in the Ontario market. Already having a successful Harley Davidson store in Sudbury, Ontario (The Rock) made the opportunity to acquire Forest City Mazda that much more appealing. Bringing the group to a total of 29 rooftops stretching from British Columbia to Ontario.

While FFUN operates multiple highly successful dealerships, the company is a proud supporter of each community they live and work in through the FFUN Spirit division. Aiding youth, local sports and health initiatives with financial assistance and volunteer opportunities within each community they serve. As an employer of 575 team members (and counting) across Canada, the company will continue on its growth path while serving the communities they operate in. “FFUN is a value-based organization,” adds Loeppky. “Getting to know Jay (Maroney), the General Manager and his staff here, we have been blown away by the positivity and desire to scale this business. We look forward to not only providing a better product offering for the London area but participating and growing this community as well.”
