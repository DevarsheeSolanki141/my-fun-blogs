The global commitment to combat climate change and slashing emissions has increased focus on finding sustainable fuel alternatives. And Canada is not being left behind.

[Electric vehicles](https://blog.ffun.com/articles/ev-revolution/) (EVs), hydrogen fuel cell technology, and other clean energy sources are leading the charge in the nation's energy transition.

This movement has the potential to transform power generation, energy storage, and our entire energy system.

Let's dive a bit deeper into this energy solution.

## Electric Vehicles and Renewable Energy

Electric vehicles are a substantial departure from the norm of internal combustion engines, offering a greener substitute that significantly reduces carbon emissions.

As energy storage techniques improve and renewable sources like hydroelectric power become integral to Canada's energy grid, the support system for EVs is rapidly developing.

- Advanced Energy Storage: Modern EVs in Canada now feature improved energy density and battery lifespan, enabling longer usage and increased charging efficiency.
- Government Backing: Canada offers a range of incentives to encourage EV adoption. This includes purchase rebates, tax incentives, and funding for charging infrastructure, promoting an expanding EV market across the country.
- Clean Electricity Integration: Merging renewable electricity with EV charging infrastructure is essential to solidifying the viability and sustainability of these vehicles.

## Hydrogen Fuel Cell Technology

First off, it's important to note that Canada is among the top ten producers of hydrogen worldwide.

Canada's Hydrogen Strategy outlines goals to use hydrogen for up to 30% of the country's energy needs and become a top global producer by 2050.

This ambition highlights Canada's commitment to climate change mitigation and emission reduction through innovative hydrogen fuel cell technologies.
- Green Hydrogen Production: Canada's focus on becoming a premier producer of clean hydrogen involves leveraging electrolysis for environmentally friendly hydrogen production, steering the country towards significant emissions cuts.
- Hydrogen Infrastructure and Innovation: Companies like Hydrogen Technology and Energy Corporation (HTEC) in Vancouver, are pivotal in making hydrogen fuel cell vehicles more accessible and promoting emissions-free energy. This is through building a robust hydrogen infrastructure, including refueling stations and adopting electrolysis technology.
- Decarbonizing Freight and Heating: Targeting the freight and heating sectors, hydrogen is a versatile tool in reducing CO2 emissions.
- International Partnerships and Economic Benefits: Through strategic international partnerships, Canada is extending its clean hydrogen and ammonia exports to critical markets — supporting global energy security needs and driving towards the collective goal of zero emissions.

## Beyond Electric and Hydrogen: The Quest for Next-Generation Fuels

While electric and hydrogen fuels are making strides towards a cleaner future, the quest for next-generation fuels continues.

Biofuels and natural gas are also top candidates for alternative fuel sources.

- Biofuels: Ethanol, created from crops like corn and wheat, blends with gasoline to fuel most current vehicles. Another form, called E85, powers Flexible Fuel Vehicles. Canada mandates an average ethanol content of five percent in gasoline. Diesel also has renewable forms—biodiesel and hydrogenation-derived Derived Renewable Diesel (HDRD). Made from oils or fats, these are mixed with diesel, with HDRD overcoming some traditional biodiesel limitations.
- Natural Gas: Predominantly methane, it's used as Compressed Natural Gas (CNG) or Liquefied Natural Gas (LNG) in vehicles. Their adoption faces challenges, like limited infrastructure and high conversion costs.
