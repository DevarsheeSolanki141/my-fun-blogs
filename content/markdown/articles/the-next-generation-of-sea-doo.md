Sea-Doo has been consistently providing the most innovative personal watercraft year after year, and 2020 is no different. Redesigned to increase your experience on the water, the newest Sea-Doo models including the GTI, GTR 230 and WAKE 170 models all come equipped with the new platform upgrades such as an increased stability, a sound system, more storage space, and the toughest hull in the game. The new platform has positioned itself the ultimate family-fun recreational watercraft. Stretch your legs, head into rougher waters, bring more snacks, and play louder tracks – this is your Sea-Doo life, after all.

“The platform is practically a living room on the water, with more room to sprawl out and enjoy the ride. It is also widely accepted as the industry benchmark for stability and control, all at a great value.” – Dave McMahon, Powersports Business

With the new models, there is definitely space to sprawl out. With comfy, modular 3-Up seating, and a useful and large swim platform, the newest design makes hanging out just as fun as riding around.

AT REST. AT SPEED. ALWAYS STEADY.
The new models are Stable to Its Core. Our most stable platform ever is the industry standard in rough waters. So whether you’re parked in a cove or hauling at speed, these Sea-Doo models feel steady and sure. Even with three on board or someone boarding, it’ll stay true.

“I found the hull indeed feels impressively rigid, especially when encountering waves. There was no jarring feel or sounds as I flew across wave tops. Instead, it felt solid… and surprisingly quiet.” – Jeff Hemmel, PersonalWatercraft.com
