Volkswagen Tiguan is the brand’s current bestseller, breaking six million sales since model’s debut

- **Tiguan is now best-selling model in the Volkswagen Group, and one of the top three best-selling SUVs**
- **Production has increased from 120,000 a year in 2007 to just shy of 911,000 units in 2019**
- **Volkswagen will unveil a refreshed Tiguan later in 2020, featuring new front and rear styling, a redesigned interior and new powertrains**

Wolfsburg (Germany) – In spring 2020, the Volkswagen Tiguan broke the production barrier of six million units, with 910,926 units manufactured in 2019 alone. This makes the Tiguan the best-selling car in the Volkswagen brand and Group. This versatile vehicle is available for sale in 80 percent of countries in the world and is the most successful SUV on the market in Europe. Volkswagen produces the Tiguan in four time zones across three continents. On average, a brand new example rolled off the production line every 35 seconds in one of the company’s Tiguan factories last year.

The world première of the first generation Tiguan took place at the Frankfurt International Motor Show (IAA) in Frankfurt back in 2007. Later that year, the first Tiguan came to market. Since then, the vehicle has enjoyed a meteoric rise. In 2008, Volkswagen manufactured more than 150,000 units, making it the most successful SUV in Germany, from a standing start. And, from the outset, the new model was also in demand worldwide. A significantly updated version of the best-seller was unveiled in 2011 and was a resounding success: the annual Tiguan volume subsequently broke the 500,000 barrier for the first time.

The second-generation Tiguan arrived on the market in April 2016. The SUV was now based on the Modular Transverse Toolkit (MQB), which allowed for an authentic and muscular SUV design. The interior was considerably roomier owing to the longer wheelbase, while new assist systems enhanced the vehicle’s active safety.

The product line was revamped again in 2017 with the debut of a second Tiguan model—an XL version with a wheelbase extended by 4.3 inches, up to seven seats, and a bespoke design. The new version gave the product line another major boost, since 55 percent of all Tiguan models have the longer wheelbase—all North American versions have the longer wheelbase. In European markets and in many other countries, the long-wheelbase model was launched as the Tiguan Allspace, while it is marketed as the Tiguan L1 in China. In October 2019, Volkswagen added a plug-in hybrid drivetrain for the Chinese model.

The Tiguan is currently manufactured at four Volkswagen plants spread across four time zones, thus ensuring almost around-the-clock production. The normal wheelbase (NWB) version is manufactured at Volkswagen’s main plant in Wolfsburg, Germany, for markets in Europe, Africa, Asia and Oceania. The Kaluga plant, 104 miles south-west of Moscow, produces the NWB vehicles for the Russian market and for neighboring Central Asian countries. In Shanghai, Volkswagen manufactures the LWB Tiguan L for the Chinese market. In the Mexican city of Puebla, the LWB versions1 of the Tiguan are produced for North and South America and for countries in Europe, Africa, Asia and Oceania.

Over two generations, the Tiguan has developed into one of the most successful SUVs in the world. During this period it has become one of the production mainstays of the Volkswagen brand and Group. Volkswagen is preparing to launch the next chapter of the Tiguan success story with a major technical and visual update of the NWB version in 2020. Highlights include:

- Revised front and rear fascias that give a more muscular appearance
- The MIB III infotainment system is used for the first time in the Tiguan
- New assistance systems such as Travel Assist
- A new plug-in hybrid drivetrain for Europe.
