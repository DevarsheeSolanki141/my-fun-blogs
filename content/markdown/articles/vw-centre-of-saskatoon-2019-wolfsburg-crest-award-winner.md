VW Centre of Saskatoon Wolfsburg Crest Award Winner
VW Centre of Saskatoon Wolfsburg Crest Award Winner

At the FFUN Group, one of our core values is Driven to Grow. We are the reason for our success. We are great people who are excited about continuous growth and improvement through education and learning from our experiences.

It’s a value that carries us to be better every day, but only truly is achieved when our drive to grow actually delivers growth results for the business and our customers. [At Volkswagen Centre of Saskatoon](https://www.vwcentre.com/) we can firmly say we’ve achieved that this year, after being recognized with the [2019 Volkswagen Wolfsburg Crest Club award.](https://www.vw.ca/en/shopping_tools/wolfsburg_crest_club.html)

The Wolfsburg Crest Award is given to the Volkswagen dealers that have met the highest operating standards in Canada. It is an award based on much more than just numbers, as it heavily favours Customer Experience Survey scores, completed by both sales and service. So you, our customer are truly determining how successful we are, and the standards of excellence we’ve achieved for sales and service. 36 dealers across Canada achieved the results to net them in this prestigious club, but the FFUN Motor Group and Volkswagen Centre of Saskatoon are the only dealership in Saskatchewan and Manitoba to receive the recognition.

“We are so excited and humbled to have received this award,” notes Chris Belfour, General Manager at the Volkswagen Centre of Saskatoon. “The Wolfsburg Crest Award has been a goal for this dealership for a last few years. It’s something we’ve been building up to and validates that the hard work and extra effort we’ve been putting in for our customers, every day, is truly paying off. Thank you to all of our staff, customers and friends for making this possible.”

Membership into the Wolfsburg Crest Club is a well-deserved recognition for the Volkswagen Centre of Saskatoon and is a fitting step towards their next big initiative as they look to move to their brand new home in the Saskatchewan Motor Village in the north end of Saskatoon, near Costco, beginning May 1.

With a particular attention to detail and fast, friendly atmosphere for its customers, the Volkswagen Centre of Saskatoon truly is a unique car buying experience on the Prairies. Drop by to see for yourself what it means to be a VW Wolfsburg Crest Club dealer.

The Wolfsburg Crest Club got its name from the location of the world’s biggest car plant. Opened in 1938 and located in North Germany, Wolfsburg is the headquarters of the Volkswagen Group.
