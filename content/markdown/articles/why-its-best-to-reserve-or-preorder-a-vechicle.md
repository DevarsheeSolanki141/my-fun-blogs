Pre-ordering or reserving a vehicle is considered the smatter choice for obvious reasons. The dealership lot may not feature the car you’re looking for. You can settle for the option closest to your dream car or drive for miles looking for a dealer stock with your desired model. An even better alternative is to pre-order your vehicle. There are many incentives for reserving your next car, whether you want it new or used. Here are four reasons why it’s best to pre-order your new car:

#### **Get The Car You Want**

Pre-ordering is precisely what the name implies. Instead of settling for what the dealer stock has, you get to order the specific vehicle you desire. When pre-ordering a car, you can decide the year, make, model, trim, colour, features, and many other aspects. It doesn’t matter whether you want to be the first to open your new vehicle or seek a user car. The option allows you to request what you want. After pre-ordering, the dealership will make a request and wait for the manufacturer to produce the exact vehicle ordered. The manufacturer will assemble the car and ship it to the dealership, where you can collect it.

#### **Avoid Dealership Shortages**

A pre-order or factory order allows you to skip dealership shortages and order the exact trim You want. You’ll find vehicles with the broadest appeal when you visit a car dealership. Pre-ordering is the best way to go if you want something different, like an electric vehicle or a unique colour that isn’t popular with the crowd. You can forget about the pandemic shortages and low stock impediments. A pre-order allows you to get any car you want, whether or not it is available at the local dealership. All you need to do is check whether the manufacturer’s website features your desired model. If it’s still being manufactured, you can factory order it through the dealership.

#### **Pay For Features You Need**

Customization is one of the incentives for making a special order for your new car. You get to ask the automaker to include specific features and do away with others. A pre-order allows you to pay for the exact features you want and bypass the MSRP numbers. The order process is also seamless and convenient. All it takes is a few minutes to fill out the special order form. Car buyers can get beyond standard packages that lack specific addictions they need by requesting unique integrations in the pre-order. The automaker will review the order and customize your new car as requested. Whether you need a custom sound system or special colour, the dealership will make sure your needs are met.

#### **Save Time & Effort**

Pre-ordering allows you to get the best car with minimal effort. The car purchase is online, and you can order the car in the specific way you want. Whether you need a Ford F-150, Tesla, Toyota, or Cadilac, the car sales dealership will send your request to the manufacturer and handle the hard part.

Once delivered, the salesperson will invite you for a test drive, letting you explore the car and complete the paperwork. Pre-ordering also allows you to trade in your used car.

#### **Key Takeaways About Pre-Ordering A Car**

A pre-order lets you get customized features and trims with the same warranty options as a dealership. The difference is you get to purchase your dream car without compromising.
